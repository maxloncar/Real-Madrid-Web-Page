                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p><abbr title="Real Madrid Club de Fútbol">Real Madrid CF</abbr>, commonly referred to as <strong>Real Madrid</strong>, 
                    is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. Real 
                    Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century, 
                    and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit. The club was 
                    also awarded Best European Club of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century by the IFFHS. 
                    In June 2017, the team succeeded in becoming the first club to win 
                    back to back Champions Leagues, then made it three in a row, extending 
                    their lead atop the UEFA club rankings</p>

                    <h3>Crests</h3>
                    <p>The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, 
                    <abbr title="Madrid Club de Fútbol">MCF</abbr>, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 
                    when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration 
                    of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted 
                    the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title "Real Madrid," meaning "Royal. Thus, Alfonso's crown 
                    was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.</p>

                    <h3>Colours</h3>
                    <p>Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, 
                        one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; 
                        the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., one of the most 
                        famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts 
                        in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by 
                        Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, 
                        claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the 
                        shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid 
                        at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United 
                        permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.</p>
